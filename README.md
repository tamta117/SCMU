## Efficacy of remote monitoring tools in the detection of predation events on a rare seabird

This repository contains pre-processed camera trap and acoustic monitoring data at 5 breeding locations for Scripps's murrelets *Synthliboramphus scrippsi* at Anacapa Island in Channel Islands National Park. Units were deployed during the breeding season (~February to June) in 2021 and 2022. 

This repository contains the following files:  

1. Data   
    + the `acoustic` folder contains the pre-processed acoustic data in text files by each breeding location. Data is grouped by site and files are split into murrelet and raven positive detections. Acoustic data was processed using Raven Pro software. 
    + the `camera` folder contains 
    + `ai_scmu_sites.csv` contains GPS latitude/longitude coordinates for the 5 breeding locations.    

2. Scripts  
    + `data_compilation.R` is the script to compile, reformat, and clean tracking data. Tracking data was pulled from CIES Data Google Drive in May 2022 and cross-referenced with NPS files (from Rocky Rudolph) to create a complete data set. Only distinct records were maintained.
